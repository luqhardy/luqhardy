My name is Luqman Hadi. I am currently a Video Editor, Graphics Designer and Motion Graphics Designer.
I also aspire to learn programming and be a Software Engineer in the next 5 years, which is why I created this Github account on March 2022.
I have been interested in programming and UI/UX Design for a long time, and figured that it would be great to learn it in my free time.
Currently self-learning HTML, Python and Japanese.

You can reach me on @luqhardy on IG or Twitter.
